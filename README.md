# Party Pack 🎉

A big-screen party game hub. The host opens the app on a TV or laptop, everyone
joins from their phones by scanning a QR code (or typing the 4-letter room
code), and the host picks which game the group plays. Players stay connected in
one room across games.

## Running it

The app is plain HTML/CSS/JS, but it uses ES modules and QR-code joining, so it
needs to be served over http(s) rather than opened as a `file://`:

```bash
cd party-pack
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://<your-computer's-LAN-IP>:8000` on the big screen. Phones on
the same network scan the QR code that appears. (Any static host — GitHub
Pages, Netlify, etc. — works too, and lets phones join from anywhere.)

## Project layout

```
index.html              app shell (host + controller markup)
css/main.css            shared shell/lobby/controller styles
css/topbanana.css       Top Banana game styles
js/main.js              networking, lobby, roster, game registry, routing
js/util.js              shared side-effect-free helpers
js/games/topbanana.js   Apples-to-Apples-style judging game
js/games/sweetpath.js   Sweet Path placeholder (porting guide inside)
```

`main.js` owns everything network-shaped: the PeerJS room, join/reconnect flow,
and the roster. Games never touch a connection — the shell routes messages to
and from the active game module.

## Games

**Top Banana 🍌** (3–10 players) — each round one player is the Banana Judge.
The big screen shows a golden prompt card; everyone else secretly plays the
answer card from their hand of 7 that matches it best. The judge crowns a
winner, who earns a banana. First to 5 bananas wins. All card text is original.

**Sweet Path 🍭** — reserved on the menu as "coming soon." The comment block in
`js/games/sweetpath.js` walks through how to port the existing single-file game
into the module interface.

## Adding a game

1. Create `js/games/yourgame.js` exporting the module interface (documented at
   the top of `js/main.js`): menu metadata plus `createHost(ctx)` and
   `createController(ctx)` factories.
2. Create `css/yourgame.css` with a unique class prefix and link it from
   `index.html`.
3. Import the module in `js/main.js` and add it to the `GAMES` array.

That's it — the menu card, player routing, and reconnect handling come for free.
